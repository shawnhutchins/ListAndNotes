DOING
-make the save button save the the note being edited rather than making a new note.

(finished) -create a view for editing notes that is seperate from the note creation page so that dont have to always have the note variable being passed even when its not needed like when creating a new note.

(finished) -create a view for notes


THINGS TO DO LATER
-I have been looking into different project structures. In the future I would like to rename public, client and move most of what is in app.js into a server.js file which would be in a server folder. Then I would create either main.js or app.js in the main directory as the start point.
